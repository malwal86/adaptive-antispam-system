# Deployment & Continuous Delivery

How the Living Anti-Spam System goes live and stays live: **every push to `main`
is tested in CI, then deployed, then smoke-tested against the live URL.**

```
                         GitHub (main)
                              │  push / merged PR
            ┌─────────────────┴──────────────────┐
            ▼                                     ▼
   GitHub Actions CI                       Vercel Git integration
   ├─ Java build + test                    └─ console: preview per branch/PR,
   ├─ console build + e2e                     production on main  (auto)
   └─ on green main:
        ├─ POST Render deploy hook  ──────▶ Render: living-antispam (Docker, Java API)
        └─ smoke test live API (/info commit match → /analyze == block)
```

- **API → Render** (Docker web service). Deploys are **CI-gated** (`autoDeploy:
  false`); the CI deploy hook fires only after a green build.
- **Console → Vercel** (Next.js). Vercel builds **every** push automatically:
  a preview deployment per branch/PR and production on `main`.
- **Postgres → Supabase** (source-of-truth store).

You do the one-time account/dashboard setup below once. After that it's hands-off:
push → merge → live.

## One-time setup

Accounts needed: [Supabase](https://supabase.com), [Render](https://render.com),
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) — all have free tiers. Do the steps **in order**
(the order resolves the API-URL ↔ console-URL chicken-and-egg).

### 1. Supabase Postgres

1. Create a new Supabase project; pick a strong DB password.
2. Project → **Connect** (or Settings → Database) → copy the connection details.
   You need the **host**, **port** (`5432`), **database** (`postgres`), **user**,
   and **password**. Build the JDBC URL:
   ```
   APP_POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://db.<your-ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   APP_POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   APP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<the password you set>
   ```
   > **Use the Transaction-mode pooler (port `6543`).** Render can't route IPv6,
   > so the IPv4 pooler host (`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`) is required and
   > the user becomes `postgres.<project-ref>`. Prefer port `6543` (transaction
   > mode) over `5432` (session mode): session mode caps the project's TOTAL client
   > connections at `pool_size` (15 by default), so the runtime pool + Flyway + a
   > deploy's overlapping instance exhaust it and boot dies with
   > `FATAL (EMAXCONNSESSION)`. Transaction mode lifts that cap and returns the
   > server connection per transaction. The app sets `prepareThreshold=0` for you so
   > server-side prepared statements don't break across pooled connections.
   > ```
   > APP_POSTGRES_URL=jdbc:postgresql://aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
   > APP_POSTGRES_USER=postgres.<project-ref>
   > ```
   > Flyway runs migrations on boot, so the user must own the `public` schema (the
   > default `postgres` user does).

### 2. Render — the Java API

Easiest path is the blueprint:

1. Render Dashboard → **New** → **Blueprint** → connect the GitHub repo
   `malwal86/adaptive-antispam-system`. Render reads [`render.yaml`](render.yaml)
   and proposes the `living-antispam` web service.
2. When prompted, set the env vars marked `sync: false`:
   - `APP_POSTGRES_URL`, `APP_POSTGRES_USER`, `APP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — from step 1.
   - `ANTISPAM_CONSOLE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — leave as `https://*.vercel.app` for now
     (you'll have an exact URL after step 3; the wildcard already covers Vercel).
   - `APP_REDIS_URL` / `APP_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` already have placeholder
     values in `render.yaml` — leave them; they aren't connected yet.
3. Apply. Wait for the first build to go green and `/health` to report `UP`.
4. Note the service URL, e.g. `https://living-antispam.onrender.com`.
5. Settings → **Deploy Hook** → copy the hook URL (used by CI to trigger deploys).

> `autoDeploy` is **off** by design — CI is the deploy trigger, so a red build
> never ships. The deploy hook is how CI tells Render to build.

### 3. Vercel — the console

1. Vercel → **Add New… → Project** → import the same GitHub repo.
2. **Root Directory** → set to `console` (the Next.js app lives in a subdirectory).
   Framework auto-detects as **Next.js**; leave build/output defaults.
3. Environment Variables → add:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = https://living-antispam.onrender.com   (your step-2 URL)
   ```
   Add it for **Production, Preview, and Development** so preview deploys also hit
   the live API. (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is inlined at build time, so it must be set
   before the build.)
4. Deploy. Note the production URL, e.g. `https://adaptive-antispam-system.vercel.app`.

### 4. Tighten CORS (optional but recommended)

The `https://*.vercel.app` wildcard already lets the production **and** preview
console call the API. If you later add a custom domain, append it:

- Render → `living-antispam` → Environment → edit `ANTISPAM_CONSOLE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
  ```
  https://*.vercel.app,https://your-custom-domain.com
  ```
- Save → Render redeploys the API.

### 5. GitHub — CI deploy + live smoke test

Give CI the deploy hook and the live URL. From a shell with `gh` authenticated:

```bash
# Secret: the Render deploy hook from step 2.5
gh secret set RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL --repo malwal86/adaptive-antispam-system \
  --body 'https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-xxxxxxxx?key=yyyyyyyy'

# Variable: the live API base URL from step 2.4 (public, so a variable not a secret)
gh variable set LIVE_API_URL --repo malwal86/adaptive-antispam-system \
  --body 'https://living-antispam.onrender.com'
```

(Or set them in GitHub → repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.)

If `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` is unset, CI skips the deploy step (no failure); if
`LIVE_API_URL` is unset, it skips the smoke test.

---

## The ongoing flow (after setup)

1. Work on a branch, open a PR. CI runs the **full** suite (Java unit +
   integration with Testcontainers, console unit + Playwright E2E) on the PR.
   Vercel posts a **preview** URL on the PR — the real UI against the live API.
2. Merge to `main`. On the green `main` build, CI:
   - triggers the Render API deploy,
   - polls `/info` until the new commit is the one serving,
   - asserts `/health` is `UP` and a denylisted-URL email returns `tier=block`.
   Vercel independently promotes the console to **production**.
3. Both URLs now serve the new build. The Actions run is green only if the live
   API actually came up and decided correctly.

## Verifying it works

```bash
# API health + a live decision
curl -s https://living-antispam.onrender.com/health
curl -s https://living-antispam.onrender.com/info       # shows version + commit
curl -s -X POST https://living-antispam.onrender.com/analyze \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"raw":"From: x@promo.example\nSubject: hi\n\nhttp://malware.example/login\n"}'
# → {"tier":"block","routeUsed":"hard_rule",...}

# Console: open the Vercel URL, paste an email or pick a sample, watch the card.
```

## Cost envelope & the pause lever

The hosted demo is meant to stay **always-on through interview season without
runaway cost**. Two facts make that affordable:

- **The flat layer never pauses.** Render (Java API) and Vercel (console) are on
  flat/effectively-always-on plans, so the public URLs answer `/health` and serve
  the console continuously. LLM spend can't run away either — it's bounded by the
  Redis cost cap (story 05.04), not hope.
- **The metered layer can pause between demos.** The two dependencies that bill by
  uptime — **Aiven** (Kafka) and **Supabase** (Postgres) — are the cheapest idle
  lever. Powering Aiven off and pausing the Supabase project preserves both
  (config + data) while stopping their compute meters.

| State | Roughly | What's running |
|---|---|---|
| **Idle floor** | **~$35/mo** | Render + Vercel up; Aiven powered off; Supabase paused |
| **PRD floor** | **~$70/mo** | everything up, light use |
| **Active season** | **~$100–140/mo** | everything up, demo traffic + LLM within the cap |

### The lever — `ops/cost-lever.sh`

A reproducible IaC toggle over the two metered deps (it deliberately leaves
Render + Vercel up so the demo never 404s):

```bash
ops/cost-lever.sh pause     # power off Aiven + pause Supabase  → idle ~$35/mo
ops/cost-lever.sh resume    # power on  Aiven + restore Supabase → back to live
ops/cost-lever.sh status    # report the current power state of both
```

It is **idempotent** (re-running `pause`/`resume` is a no-op) and takes every
credential from the environment — never the repo (same rule as `render.yaml`):

```bash
export AIVEN_TOKEN=...            AIVEN_PROJECT=...   AIVEN_KAFKA_SERVICE=...
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=...  SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=...
```

**Ops drill (spin back up before a demo):** `ops/cost-lever.sh resume`, wait for
Supabase to report `ACTIVE_HEALTHY` (~a minute) and Aiven to leave `POWEROFF`,
then confirm the live API recovered:

```bash
curl -s https://living-antispam.onrender.com/health   # → {"status":"UP"}
curl -s https://living-antispam.onrender.com/info      # build version of the live image
```

The build version in `/info` (story 01.01, stamped by Gradle `buildInfo`) is how
you confirm *which* build is serving after a resume or a restart.

## Notes & gotchas

- **Cold starts:** Render's free/starter plan sleeps idle services; the first
  request after idle (and the CI smoke poll) can take ~30–60 s. The smoke test
  allows ~15 min for a fresh build to go live.
- **Redis/Kafka** are placeholders (`redis://placeholder:6379`, `placeholder:9092`)
  — the app only validates they're *present*, it doesn't connect yet. Replace them
  when Epics 02/03 land.
- **The smoke test writes one row** to the live DB per deploy (`source=ci-smoke`).
  Ingest is idempotent (same bytes dedupe), so emails don't pile up; only a
  `classifications` row is added each run. Harmless for a demo.
- **Secrets never live in the repo** — only env vars in the Render/Vercel
  dashboards and GitHub Actions secrets.
- **Preview CORS:** previews work live because the API allows `https://*.vercel.app`.
  If you scope CORS to an exact production origin only, preview deploys won't be
  able to call the API (the UI loads, requests fail).

## Troubleshooting (issues actually hit during first setup)

- **Nothing deploys / Vercel 404 / API has no `/analyze`:** the 01.05 code must be
  **merged to `main`** first — Render and Vercel build `main`, not an open PR.
- **Render 502, logs show `java.net.SocketException: Network is unreachable`:**
  you used Supabase's **Direct connection** (`db.<ref>.supabase.co`, IPv6-only) —
  Render can't route IPv6. Switch `APP_POSTGRES_URL` to the IPv4 pooler
  (`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`) and set `APP_POSTGRES_USER` to
  `postgres.<project-ref>`. Use port **`6543`** (transaction mode), not `5432` —
  see the next entry for why.
- **Boot dies with `FATAL: (EMAXCONNSESSION) max clients reached in session mode -
  max clients are limited to pool_size: 15`:** you're on the **session-mode**
  pooler (port `5432`). Session mode caps the project's TOTAL client connections at
  `pool_size`, and a crash-loop leaks those slots faster than Supavisor reaps them,
  so Flyway can't get a connection on boot. Fix: repoint `APP_POSTGRES_URL` to the
  **transaction-mode** pooler — same host, port **`6543`** — which lifts the cap and
  releases server connections per transaction. This both unblocks the stuck deploy
  (transaction mode doesn't touch the exhausted session slots) and prevents it
  recurring. The app already bounds its own pool (`APP_DB_POOL_MAX`, default 5) and
  sets `prepareThreshold=0` for transaction-mode compatibility.
- **`/info` shows `commit: "unknown"`:** the JDK build image had no `git`. Fixed in
  the `Dockerfile` (installs git + marks `/app` a safe.directory) so the commit is
  stamped — required for the CI live smoke test to detect the new build.
- **Vercel build logs look "fine" but the site 404s:** the **Root Directory** isn't
  set to `console`, so Vercel builds the repo root (no `package.json` there) and
  produces nothing. Set **Project → Settings → Build & Deployment → Root Directory
  → `console`** and redeploy. A correct build log says `next build` + lists routes.
- **Vercel clean domain 404 even though a build succeeded:** the domain is attached
  to **Production** but there's no **Production** deployment (your builds were
  Previews). Either **Promote to Production** the Ready deployment (Deployments →
  ⋯ → Promote to Production) or set the production branch to `main`
  (**Settings → Environments → Production → Branch Tracking**, in newer UI — it's
  no longer under Settings → Git) and push.
- **Vercel deployment URL returns 401 "Authentication Required":** that's
  **Deployment Protection** (Vercel Authentication). For a public demo, disable it:
  **Settings → Deployment Protection → Vercel Authentication → Disabled**.
